Hi, welcome to my site! I'm a second-year undergrad at the University of Washington, Seattle studying astro/physics and poli sci. 

Here's some random favorites.
Subject in school: All of them, but probably math or history
Color: yellow and purple. Which I just realized are the UW colors. This is a coincidence. 
Radio station: WNYC
Bird: The chickadee or owl (favorite animal)
Vegetable: I love the versatile potato

Feel free to reach out. I'm not on the socials but my email is akhilaanya[at]icloud[dot]com. I've had a couple blogs in the past, but I want a real website that's "official" under my actual name.
