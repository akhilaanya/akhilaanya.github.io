I am a second-year undergrad at the University of Washington studying astro/phys and poli sci. I have experience working for the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, NASA, and McDonald Observatory at the University of Texas at Austin (including [HETDEX](https://hetdex.org)). I published/presented research at the American Geophysical Union (AGU) in December 2023, using entirely citizen-science data to automate calculations of galactic redshift. At the UW, I am also a member of the [Astronomy Undergraduate Engineering Group](https://uwmro.github.io) where we just revamped the focus system! It's super cool! 

My research interests include binary star systems, dark energy, surveying, and cosmology. I enjoy working with hardware, like for radio astronomy purposes. I'm also particularly passionate about asylum law and human rights work. I regularly write special counsel reports and translate/fill the I-589 form for the refugee-oriented nonprofit [Casa Marianella](https://www.casamarianella.org/about-us/) in my hometown of Austin, Texas. 

Aside from work and school, I play the tenor saxophone in jazz/concert bands, run half marathons, read and write a lot, do all sorts of puzzles, and grow carrots/peppers/tomatoes. I also enjoy the occasional bike ride. 

I'm really not on the socials, but I've included my email below! Send me whatever's on your mind. I promise I'll listen or read or watch any recommendation sent my way.
