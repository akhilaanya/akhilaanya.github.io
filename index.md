This site hosts my blog, as well as currently-unfinished personal projects, including my first full-length album, original and novel-based screenplays, some poetry, and other things TBA.

I am a second-year undergrad at the University of Washington triple majoring in astronomy, physics, and political science. I decided to stop affiliating this website with my school/work life, so that's all you need to know! ;)

I play the tenor saxophone in jazz/concert bands, run long-distance, read and write a lot, do all sorts of puzzles, and garden. I also enjoy the occasional bike ride, and increasingly love painting! 

You can contact me at my (personal) email below! Please send whatever's on your mind, even feedback on my writing, but I'd especially listen to, watch, or read any recommendations.
