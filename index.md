I am a second-year undergrad at the University of Washington studying astro/phys and poli sci. I have experience working for the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, NASA, and McDonald Observatory at the University of Texas at Austin (including [HETDEX](https://hetdex.org)). I published/presented research at the American Geophysical Union (AGU) in December 2023, using entirely citizen-science data to automate calculations of galactic redshift. 

My research interests include galaxies, dark energy, cosmology, and radio astronomy. I enjoy working with hardware. I'm also particularly passionate about asylum law and refugee-oriented nonprofits.

Aside from work and school, I play the tenor saxophone in jazz/concert bands, run half marathons, read and write a lot, do all sorts of puzzles, and grow carrots/peppers/tomatoes. I also enjoy the occasional bike ride.
