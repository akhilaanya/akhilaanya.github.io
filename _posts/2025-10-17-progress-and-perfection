# progress _and_ perfection

Life-changing epiphanies, or lack thereof; change and progress is slow! 

#### part 1 

I started playing the saxophone because in third grade, I waited to fill the instrumentation form until the night before it was due. I only remembered the saxophone and violin so that's what I put down. It's been over a decade since that moment and I still play the saxophone! 

We decided to move to Texas on a whim: the night before the deposit for my new school was due, I went to jazz band rehearsal. When I came back, we talked some more and paid the money. We were so on-the-fence that it could have really gone either way. Being from Texas is now a core part of my identity and how I perceive the world, as a political scientist notably but as a person too. I try to live slower than the hustle-bustle of New England, to strike up conversations with random people. And of course, I probably wouldn't be interested in running, theology, or tacos without knowing the people (and restaurants) I associate with them.

Which brings me to my final point (I know, I know, thank god) that change and progress is slow! 

#### finale: other life events, current reads and watches and listens 

I feel that I should end these posts with some personal updates, rather than only being a series of letters on the screen. 

I am a fellow now at the Center for Environmental Politics! I attended a colloquium and lunch this afternoon in that capacity, with Professor David Vogel of the University of California, Berkeley. I felt deeply out of place at the lunch, being the only undergrad there out of 6 people total, all vastly more qualified than I. But the food was good and obviously the conversation was riveting. I felt very fancy-academic at this talk and will make a habit of going. 

Please excuse the utter lack of blog posts! Every Monday morning, I declare Thursday evening writing time, and by the time Friday-eve rolls around, I'm too busy with schoolwork or prefer to sleep. I did write some of a post last week, but it never uploaded... I put it back on the list for another time. I can only promise a desire to do better. 

I'm thinking about dropping my current community band for a quarter and taking up a university one that better fits my schedule. I love the people and the music, but it's been difficult to balance amid my other responsibilities. 

Hanging out with friends a lot less this year. We keep different schedules and live much further apart. But bubble tea turned into dinner last night and I felt very fulfilled, a strong sense of belonging. I tried on my best friend's four-inch boots and was kind of jealous of tall people. 

I got a fairly disappointing rejection last week—it's not a forever no, and possibly/probably will flip back soon, but it had started as a yes. It was out of my control (and, frankly, theirs) and I'd realized before that I wouldn't enjoy that opportunity the way one needs to. But I hadn't failed in a while so I'd almost forgotten its characteristic sting. 

I'm just focusing on schoolwork, which consequently is going very well. I'm waiting to get into my third major, and then I'll officially be a physics, astronomy, and political science student.
