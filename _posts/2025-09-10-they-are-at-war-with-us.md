# they are at war with us

Charlie Kirk died this afternoon after being shot in the neck while speaking at Utah Valley University, on behalf of his organization Turning Point USA. 

This blog post was almost about something different: an Israeli affiliate said on Al Jazeera, in essence, that children in Gaza deserve no empathy for all they go through. I wanted to write about why that pains me, especially as someone with no strong opinion on the politics itself--which itself is a position, in some ways. Omar El Akkad and Mehdi Hassan would have a field day with me. And I promise I will get to that but now things have changed, and we are moving on... for now. 

These days I watch almost no TV except for moderate cable news and football. (A blog post about why is forthcoming.) It's mostly Al Jazeera and BBC, for both CNN and Fox News are headache-inducing to me. Not everything is breaking news, and the world is not burning. But sometimes, on days like these, when I open BBC News at 2 pm on a Wednesday afternoon to read that a man I generally dislike(d) was shot at a political rally promoting an ideology I more than generally repudiate, I will want to know what my own country is saying about it. 

A news anchor on Fox, though, said (direct quotes) "they are at war with us." And that stayed with me for the wrong reasons. Not only because of the divisiveness, not not even the bigotry that followed ("trans shooters" was also thrown around) 



In personal news, this is day four without my phone or social media. (Expect something about this, too.) I sat in Barnes & Noble for a good 2.5 hours while my mom did bloodwork. Read "I'll Never Call Him Dad Again" by Caroline Darian which was, let's say, harrowing. I also got a new 100% recycled journal, by VENT for Change. I'll go for a run in the evening, practice my saxophone, keep working on my butterfly puzzle, and maybe do some art to close out today. My new glasses are ready for pickup. Exciting.
