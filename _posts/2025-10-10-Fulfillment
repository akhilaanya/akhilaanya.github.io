It's been a while since I've updated this blog... I've been busy! Not that I'm not right now, but I've been on a medication to control my shockingly low iron levels. It makes me very sick. I've been up since about 5 am, throwing up and getting really terrible nausea that debilitates me to lying down and munching some plain crackers. I promise I am not actually sick with a virus. I have been to the doctor. There's no flu, no stomach bug, and this is a known side effect. So, I live with it, the best anyone can. 

But now I'm staying home from school today, and I think I've had a shift this week in what I want to do with my life, so I want to write about that! 

#### part 1: the context

I've had a rough time keeping up since classes started. I'm triple majoring, in physics, astronomy and political science, so I never thought college would be easy. I don't want it to be! I'm at a wonderful school and I'm not about to waste that. But it's still super hard. 

I took mostly small honors classes last year, especially in calculus and physics. Where the regular lectures had upwards of 200 students, both of mine had around 30. Sometimes, near breaks or on Fridays, the classroom would only have 10 students. So I really got to know my professors. Every single school day of my first year of undergrad I saw my math professor. There's no more honors classes as I get more into my major, so I'm back in the regular classes with about 100 other students. (Physics isn't that big of a major.)

The adjustment I didn't expect was that in those tiny classes, I could ask whatever question I wanted to. Especially for math: we met everyday, so we didn't cover that much in one day. We had time to go over everything again, so she'd stay with me until I got it. I rarely went home not understanding, and what I chose not to bring up was something I knew I could get later. And my physics professor was wonderful. She focuses on physics education, so she really knows what she's doing. 

I still have pretty great professors (with one notable exception) who want you to ask questions, but it's a different vibe I'm not used to. The teacher can't usually see my hand, and even if they want you to speak to get their attention, I can't do that all the time. We'd never get through the content, and it's just an unwritten understanding that the class doesn't cater to just you. 

So I go home not getting things sometimes, and while I have more time to study because there's way less homework, it takes so much more time. We're not just learning circuits anymore... we're throwing around terms like "momentum flux tensor." And I get way more drained after four classes of working twice as hard to understand as much as I can in the class, so my home time isn't as tedious. But it's pretty futile because I never end up getting it all at once anyway. And I do read the textbook ahead of time! But one professor likes to take theoretical approaches, which I love but is very difficult, and another is notoriously unclear. 

#### part 2: denial is a river

So I'm struggling lately with a lot of self-doubt. Other students don't ask questions, so it seems they don't have any! 

Can I keep doing this? And do I want to? 


#### part 3: gettin outta da swamp 

You don't just have to do or be one thing!

Like, the rules are different for me: my parents have certain expectations, the social order. Most importantly, I have certain expectations. 

**------------**
**I've thought about if I want to share these kinds of things on here. This website now sits in all my email signatures so really, anyone can click and read this. But my goal is honest and unashamed discourse, especially about often stigmatized topics in our social order like mental health. I'm grateful I don't struggle with it very much, but I'm not infallible or in a state of constant happiness! I get overwhelmed, I get sad, I get mad, just like every single other person. I don't see why I need to misrepresent that by only writing about nonfiction, and I think there's incredible importance in being open. Especially about shifts in how you perceive your own identity; they're way more common and toned down than the life-changing epiphanies we tend to glorify. (This will probably be the next blog post, not gonna lie.)**

**So I want to assure anyone reading that I seek support in all sorts of ways that I wouldn't necessarily talk about here. I still draw a privacy line somewhere, and you don't hear about it by virtue of its very nature. What I will say is I'm very lucky to have a strong support system of family, friends, professors, band- and team-mates, etc. I've relied on all of the above this week in many manners: advice, distractions, comfort, redirections. I know what makes me feel better, I know how to confront my feelings and thoughts in a healthy way, and I know where to find professional help if and when I need it! I'm not there right now, but it's okay if I would be, and it's okay if you are too.**
